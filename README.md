For repeatability of our paper "***A Lighweight Music Texture Transfer System***", we hereon host _uncommented_ source code for the _server-side production_ enviorment.
- Click [here](https://github.com/MusiCoder-MMM2019/for-reviewers/releases/download/4RW/MusiCoder_PC_Client.exe) to download the executable PC client demo.
- After the acceptence of our paper by [MMM 2019](http://mmm2019.iti.gr), _well-commented_ code for _training_ and _full production_ enviorments, documentation for the client as well as _trained models for more textures_, will be available in another personal repo. A pointer to it will be posted then.
- The license for the new repo will be [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) instead of our current [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/MusiCoder-MMM2019/for-reviewers/blob/master/LICENSE).
